A fun, gravity-based puzzle game built for Hack Club's Parthenon!

------
## what is this about?
We've made a sci-fi, gravity puzzle game where you control a drone in a spaceship. You turn the spaceship and the drone is pulled towards the spaceship's bottom. Here, you'll have to make your way through obstacles to reach your goal!!

## how we made this:
we used godot. with the help of tongyu, youtube tutorials, parthenon's workshops, and some chatgpt, we managed to make this.

## features:
- a main menu (soon)
- multiple levels, increasing in difficulty
- credits (soon)
- settings (soon)

## thanks and credits
